##How to contribute Use Cases

A Use Case is comprised of:

* Sponsor(s) - The name and/or organization of the person advocating for this use case. Use a github id if possible.
* Goal & Reason - Of the form "As a `<type of user>`, I want `<some goal>` so that `<some reason>`."
* Notes - Any supporting information, the basic course of action an actor would take.

You can submit a use case by one of the following methods:

* Creating an issue in Github
* Submitting a pull request that adds one or more use cases to the ./use-cases directory
* Email me (Justin Simpson) and I will add it for you

When merging a Use Case, make sure that each use case has a clear: Sponsor, Goal & Reason, and Notes. If it meets those criteria, you are free to merge.

NOTE: A merged use case does not mean it has been accepted. Only that the format is accepted. We will be synthesizing the use case at a later stage.
